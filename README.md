In my projects, I have worked extensively with Selenium WebDriver for automating web applications using Java as the programming language.

Automation Framework: I utilized the TestNG framework for creating and organizing test cases. This allowed for better structure, test management, and reporting through annotations like @Test, @BeforeClass, @AfterClass, etc. I also implemented parameterization and data-driven testing to ensure flexibility and scalability in my test suites.

Build Tool: Maven was used for project management and dependency handling, ensuring seamless integration of external libraries like Selenium, TestNG, and other necessary plugins. With Maven, I automated the build lifecycle, making it easier to manage different testing environments and CI/CD pipelines.

Defect Tracking: Jira was my primary tool for managing defects, tracking test progress, and maintaining overall project documentation. By integrating Selenium test results with Jira, I was able to report and trace bugs directly, providing clear evidence with test logs and screenshots to help developers address issues.

Reporting & Debugging: I integrated custom reporting tools like Extent Reports to generate detailed HTML reports for each test execution. This gave stakeholders a comprehensive view of the test progress and results. Additionally, I included screenshots for failed tests to assist with debugging and improve the test cycle.

Version Control & CI/CD: I worked with Git for version control, ensuring that all test scripts and configurations were managed efficiently across different branches and environments. This, combined with Jenkins, allowed for continuous integration and automated execution of test suites on scheduled builds.

End-to-End Testing: My projects included end-to-end testing of various web applications, such as user login, form submissions, and e-commerce workflows like product search, adding to cart, and checkout processes. The focus was on verifying functionality, UI interactions, and data accuracy.
